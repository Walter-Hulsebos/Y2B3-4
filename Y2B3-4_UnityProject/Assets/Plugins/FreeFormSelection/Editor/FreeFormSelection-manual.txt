== Free Form Selection ==

Press and HOLD "S" while in SceneView to start a free from selection.
SceneView must have the input focus for this to work (aka click in there once).
You can change the key in the settings (see "Push To Select Key").
Press SPACE while holding S to change the selection mode.

This is an EDITOR ONLY plugin.
This plugin enhances the selection functionality
in the SceneView of the Unity Editor. It allows you to
do a free from selection instead of the default rectangle.

Versioning will use the semantic versioning paradigm, see
https://semver.org.

= Known Issues =

* The SceneView needs to have focus in order for the keyboard shortcuts to work (aka "click into the SceneView once").
* Skinned mesh seletions are not vertex based (behave just like unitys default rect selection).
  
= Settings =

You can find or recreate the settings file (named "FreeFormSelection Settings") through the main menu (Tools > Free Form Selection > Settings). You can move it out of the plugins folder too. That's useful to avoid losing the settings if you reimport (update) the plugin.

* Enable plugin
Enables or disables the whole plugin. Turn this off if you suspect the plugin to cause any weird behaviour (none known at the moment).

* Push to select key
Push and HOLD this key to enable the current selection mode.

* Push to change mode key
Push this key while HOLDING the 'selection key' to change the selection mode. You can also change it in the Tools menu.

* Selection mode
Defines how you will specify the selection area:
   FreeForm = draw the outline freely
   Edges = draw the outline edges
   Brush = draw the selection like in paint

* Brush size
Defines how big the brush will be. Measured in scene view 2D coordinates (min. 6).

* Use mouse wheel
If enabled then you can change the brush size with the mouse wheel while selecting.

* Greedy Prefab selection
Should the whole prefab be selected if the selection area overlaps the child of a prefab (default is true).

* Include UI
Include UI elements in the selection?
  
* Max mesh vertices
Do a vertex precise selection check up to this number of vertices per mesh. Otherwise bounding boxes are used.

* Hide handles while selecting
Hide the handles (transform, rotate, ...) while selecting?
